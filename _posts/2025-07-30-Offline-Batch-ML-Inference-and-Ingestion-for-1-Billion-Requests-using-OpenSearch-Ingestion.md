In the era of large-scale machine learning (ML) applications, one of the most significant challenges is efficiently generating vector embeddings during data ingestion into OpenSearch. The process of transforming millions or even billions of documents into high-dimensional vectors using ML models has become a critical bottleneck in building effective neural search applications. While traditional real-time APIs offer a straightforward approach to vector generation, they present substantial limitations when dealing with large-scale ingestion workflows.

Real-time vector generation approaches often incur higher costs per inference and are constrained by lower rate limits, creating significant bottlenecks during the ingestion phase. As you attempt to vectorize massive document collections, these limitations result in extended ingestion times and increased operational costs. The challenge is further compounded by the complexity of orchestrating the entire pipeline---from initial document processing to vector generation and final indexing into OpenSearch.

To address these vector generation challenges and streamline the ingestion workflow, we're excited to introduce a powerful integration between OpenSearch Ingestion and ML Commons. This integration enables seamless batch ML inference processing in offline mode, allowing you to generate vectors for large-scale document collections. By optimizing the vector generation phase of the ingest pipeline, we're making it easier than ever to build and scale neural search applications efficiently.

## How does ML Commons integrate with OpenSearch Ingestion?

We have added a new [`ml_inference` processor](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/ml-inference/) to OpenSearch Ingestion in order to integrate with ML Commons for creating offline batch inference jobs. Since OpenSearch 2.17, ML Commons has provided the [Batch Predict API](https://docs.opensearch.org/latestml-commons-plugin/api/model-apis/batch-predict/), which performs inference on large datasets in offline, asynchronous mode using models deployed on external model servers such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, Cohere, and OpenAI. Integrating ML Commons with OpenSearch Ingestion incorporates the Batch Predict API into OpenSearch Ingestion, enabling OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines to run batch inference jobs during ingestion. The following diagram shows an OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline that orchestrates multiple components to perform this process end to end.

In this solution, an `s3` source monitors events for any new file generated in the inference pipeline. It then sends the new file name as an input to ML Commons for batch inference. The architecture contains three subpipelines, each performing distinct tasks in the data flow: 

* **Pipeline 1 (prepares and transforms data)** 
	1. Source: Data is ingested from an external source provided by you and supported by OpenSearch Data Prepper.
	2. Data transformation processors: The raw data is processed and transformed, preparing it in the correct format for batch inference on the remote AI server.
	3. `s3` (sink): The transformed data is then stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket as the input to the AI server, acting as an intermediary storage layer. 

* **Pipeline 2 (triggers ML batch inference)** 
	1. Source: The S3 scan monitors events for any new S3 file generated by Pipeline 1.
	2. `ml_inference` processor: Calls the ML Commons Batch Predict API to create batch jobs.
	3. Task ID: Each batch job is associated with a task ID for tracking and management.
	4. ML Commons: Hosts the model for real-time neural search, manages connectors to remote AI servers, and serves the APIs for batch inference and job management.
	5. AI services: Perform batch inference on the data, producing predictions or insights. ML Commons interacts with these AI services (such as Amazon SageMaker or Amazon Bedrock). The results are saved asynchronously to a separate S3 file.

* **Pipeline 3 (performs bulk ingestion)** 
    1. `s3` (source): Stores the results of the batch jobs. S3 is the source of this pipeline.
    2. Data transformation processors: Further process and transform the batch inference output before ingestion to ensure that the data is mapped correctly in the OpenSearch index.
    3. OpenSearch index (sink): Indexes the processed results into OpenSearch for storage, search, and further analysis.

## How to use the ml_inference processor

The current OpenSearch Ingestion implementation features a specialized integration between the S3 scan source and `ml_inference` processor for batch processing. In this initial release, the S3 scan operates in metadata-only mode, efficiently collecting S3 file information without reading the actual file contents. The `ml_inference` processor then uses the S3 file URLs to coordinate with ML Commons for batch processing. This design optimizes the batch inference workflow by minimizing unnecessary data transfer during the scanning phase.

The `ml_inference` processor can be defined with the following parameters:

```yaml
processor:
    - ml_inference:
        # The endpoint URL of your OpenSearch domain
        host: "https://search-xunzh-test-offlinebatch-kitdj4jwpiencfmxpklyvwarwa.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.comâ€œ

        # Type of inference operation:
        # - batch_predict: for batch processing
        # - predict: for real-time inference
        action_type: "batch_predict"
        
        # Remote ML model service provider (bedrock or sagemaker)
        service_name: "bedrock"
        
        # Unique identifier for the ML model
        model_id: "EzNlGZcBo9m_Jklj4T0j"
        
        # S3 path where batch inference results will be stored
        output_path: "s3://xunzh-offlinebatch/bedrock-multisource/output-multisource/"
        
        # AWS configuration settings
        aws:
            # AWS Region where the Lambda function is deployed
            region: "us-west-2"
            # IAM role ARN for Lambda function execution
            sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::388303208821:role/Admin"
            
        # Conditional expression that determines when to trigger the processor
        # In this case, only process when bucket matches "xunzh-offlinebatch"
        ml_when: /bucket == "xunzh-offlinebatch"
```

## Ingestion performance improvements using the ml_inference processor

The OpenSearch Ingestion `ml_inference` processor significantly enhances data ingestion performance for ML-enabled search. It's ideally suited for use cases requiring ML-model-generated data, including semantic search, multimodal search, document enrichment, and query understanding. In semantic search, the processor can accelerate the creation and ingestion of large-volume, high-dimensional vectors by an order of magnitude.

The processor's offline batch inference capability offers distinct advantages over real-time model invocation. While real-time processing requires a live model server with capacity limitations, batch inference dynamically scales compute resources on demand and processes data in parallel. For example, when the OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline receives 1 billion source data requests, it creates 100 S3 files for ML batch inference input. The `ml_inference` processor then initiates an Amazon SageMaker batch job using 100 `ml.m4.xlarge` Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, completing the vectorization of 1 billion requests in 14 hours---a task that would be virtually impossible to accomplish in real-time mode. This process is illustrated in the following diagram.

![SageMaker Batch Job](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-07-30-Offline-Batch-ML-Inference-and-Ingestion-for-1-Billion-Requests-using-OpenSearch-Ingestion/SageMaker_Batch_Job.png){: .img-fluid}

This solution offers excellent scalability by allowing linear reduction in processing time through the addition of more workers. For example, while the initial setup with 100 `ml.m4.xlarge` EC2 instances processed 1 billion document requests in 14 hours, doubling the worker count to 200 instances could potentially reduce the processing time to 7 hours. This linear scaling capability demonstrates the solution's flexibility in meeting various performance requirements by simply adjusting the worker count and instance type, enabling you to optimize your processing time based on your specific needs and urgency.

Additionally, most AI servers offer a batch inference API at about 50% lower cost, enabling similar performance at half the price.

## Getting started

Let's walk through a practical example of using the OpenSearch Ingestion `ml_inference` processor to ingest 1 billion data requests for semantic search using a text embedding model. 

### Step 1: Create connectors and register models in OpenSearch

Use [this blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/batch_inference_sagemaker_connector_blueprint.md) to create a connector and model in Amazon SageMaker. 

Create a Deep Java Library (DJL) ML model in Amazon SageMaker for batch transform:

```json
POST https://api.sagemaker.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CreateModel
{
   "ExecutionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::419213735998:role/aos_ml_invoke_sagemaker",
   "ModelName": "DJL-Text-Embedding-Model-imageforjsonlines",
   "PrimaryContainer": { 
      "Environment": { 
         "SERVING_LOAD_MODELS" : "djl://ai.djl.huggingface.pytorch/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" 
      },
      "Image": "763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/djl-inference:0.29.0-cpu-full"
   }
}
```

Create a connector with `batch_predict` as the new `action` type in the `actions` field:

```json

      "request_body": """{ "TransformJobName" : "${parameters.TransformJobName}"}"""
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the returned connector ID to register the Amazon SageMaker model:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
    "name": "SageMaker model for batch",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "test model",
    "connector_id": "a3Y8O5IBOcD45O-eoq1g"
}
```

Invoke the model with the `batch_predict` action type:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/teHr3JABBiEvs-eod7sn/_batch_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "TransformJobName": "SM-offline-batch-transform"
  }
}
```

The response contains a task ID for the batch job:

```json
{
 "task_id": "oSWbv5EB_tT1A82ZnO8k",
 "status": "CREATED"
}
```

To check the batch job status, use the Get Task API and provide the task ID:

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/oSWbv5EB_tT1A82ZnO8k
```

The response contains the task status:

```json

      "InputFilter": "$.content",
      "JoinSource": "Input",
      "OutputFilter": "$"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 1 (alternative): Use AWS CloudFormation 

You can use AWS CloudFormation to automatically create all required Amazon SageMaker connectors and models for ML inference. This approach simplifies setup by using a preconfigured template available in the Amazon OpenSearch Service console. For more information, see [Using AWS CloudFormation to set up remote inference for semantic search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cfn-template.html).

To deploy a CloudFormation stack that creates all the required Amazon SageMaker connectors and models, use the following steps: 

1. In the OpenSearch Service console, go to **Integrations** and search for `SageMaker`.
1. Select **Integration with text embedding models through Amazon SageMaker**.
1. Choose **Configure domain**, then select **Configure VPC domain** or **Configure public domain** as appropriate, as shown in the following image.
    ![CloudFormation Console Integration](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-07-30-Offline-Batch-ML-Inference-and-Ingestion-for-1-Billion-Requests-using-OpenSearch-Ingestion/CFN_Console_Integration.png){: .img-fluid}
1. When starting the stack deployment, set the **Enable Offline Batch Inference** dropdown list to `true` to provision resources for offline batch processing, as shown in the following image.
    ![CloudFormation Parameters](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-07-30-Offline-Batch-ML-Inference-and-Ingestion-for-1-Billion-Requests-using-OpenSearch-Ingestion/CFN_Parameters.png){: .img-fluid}
1. After the CloudFormation stack is created, open the **Outputs** tab in the CloudFormation console to find the `connector_id` and `model_id`. You will need these values for later pipeline configuration steps.

### Step 2: Create an OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline

Create your OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline using the following code in the configuration editor:

```json
version: '2'
extension:
  osis_configuration_metadata:
    builder_type: visual
sagemaker-batch-job-pipeline:
  source:
    s3:
      acknowledgments: true
      delete_s3_objects_on_read: false
      scan:
        buckets:
          - bucket:
              name: xunzh-offlinebatch
              data_selection: metadata_only
              filter:
                include_prefix:
                  - sagemaker/sagemaker_djl_batch_input
                exclude_suffix:
                  - .manifest
          - bucket:
              name: xunzh-offlinebatch
              data_selection: data_only
              filter:
                include_prefix:
                  - sagemaker/output/
        scheduling:
          interval: PT6M
      aws:
        region: us-west-2
      default_bucket_owner: 388303208821
      codec:
        ndjson:
          include_empty_objects: false
      compression: none
      workers: '1'
  processor:
    - ml_inference:
        host: "https://search-xunzh-test-offlinebatch-kitdj4jwpiencfmxpklyvwarwa.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.com"
        aws_sigv4: true
        action_type: "batch_predict"
        service_name: "sagemaker"
        model_id: "9t4AbpYBQb1BoSOe8x8N"
        output_path: "s3://xunzh-offlinebatch/sagemaker/output"
        aws:
          region: "us-west-2"
          sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::388303208821:role/Admin"
        ml_when: /bucket == "xunzh-offlinebatch"
    - copy_values:
        entries:
          - from_key: /content/0
            to_key: chapter
          - from_key: /content/1
            to_key: title
          - from_key: /SageMakerOutput/0
            to_key: chapter_embedding
          - from_key: /SageMakerOutput/1
            to_key: title_embedding
    - delete_entries:
        with_keys:
          - content
          - SageMakerOutput
  sink:
    - opensearch:
        hosts: ["https://search-xunzh-test-offlinebatch-kitdj4jwpiencfmxpklyvwarwa.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.com"]
        aws:
          serverless: false
          region: us-west-2
        routes:
          - ml-ingest-route
        index_type: custom
        index: test-nlp-index
  routes:
    - ml-ingest-route: /chapter != null and /title != null
```

### Step 3: Prepare your data for ingestion

This example uses the [MS MARCO dataset](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/Datasets.html), a collection of real user queries, for natural language processing tasks. The dataset is structured in JSONL format, where each line represents a request sent to the ML embedding model:

```json
{"_id": "1185869", "text": ")what was the immediate impact of the success of the manhattan project?", "metadata": {"world war 2"}}
{"_id": "1185868", "text": "_________ justice is designed to repair the harm to victim, the community and the offender caused by the offender criminal act. question 19 options:", "metadata": {"law"}}
{"_id": "597651", "text": "what color is amber urine", "metadata": {"nothing"}}
{"_id": "403613", "text": "is autoimmune hepatitis a bile acid synthesis disorder", "metadata": {"self immune"}}
...
```

For this test, we constructed 1 billion input requests distributed across 100 files, each containing 10 million requests. These files are stored in S3 with the prefix `s3://offlinebatch/sagemaker/sagemaker_djl_batch_input/`. The OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline scans these 100 files simultaneously and initiates an Amazon SageMaker batch job with 100 workers for parallel processing, enabling efficient vectorization and ingestion of the 1 billion documents into OpenSearch Service.

In production environments, you can use an OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline to generate S3 files for batch inference input. The pipeline supports various data sources (see [Sources](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/sources/sources/)) and operates on a schedule, continuously transforming source data into S3 files. These files are then automatically processed by AI servers through scheduled offline batch jobs, ensuring continuous data processing and ingestion.

### Step 4: Monitor the batch inference jobs

You can monitor the batch inference jobs using the Amazon SageMaker console or CLI. Alternatively, you can use the Get Task API to monitor batch jobs:

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        {
          "term": {
            "state": "RUNNING"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "_source": ["model_id", "state", "task_type", "create_time", "last_update_time"]
}
```

The API returns a list of active batch job tasks:

```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 3,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.0,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".plugins-ml-task",
        "_id": "nyWbv5EB_tT1A82ZCu-e",
        "_score": 0.0,
        "_source": {
          "model_id": "nyWbv5EB_tT1A82ZCu-e",
          "state": "RUNNING",
          "task_type": "BATCH_PREDICTION",
          "create_time": 1725496527958,
          "last_update_time": 1725496527958
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": ".plugins-ml-task",
        "_id": "miKbv5EB_tT1A82ZCu-f",
        "_score": 0.0,
        "_source": {
          "model_id": "miKbv5EB_tT1A82ZCu-f",
          "state": "RUNNING",
          "task_type": "BATCH_PREDICTION",
          "create_time": 1725496528123,
          "last_update_time": 1725496528123
        }
      },
      {

### Step 5: Run semantic search 

Now you can run a semantic search against your 1 billion vectorized data points. To search raw vectors, use the `knn` query type, provide the `vector` array as input, and specify the `k` number of returned results:

```json
GET /my-raw-vector-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "my_vector": {
        "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
        "k": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To run an AI-powered search, use the `neural` query type. Specify the `query_text` input, the `model_id` of the embedding model you configured in the OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline, and the `k` number of returned results. To exclude embeddings from search results, specify the name of the embedding field in the `_source.excludes` parameter:

```json
GET /my-ai-search-index/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": [
      "output_embedding"
    ]
  },
  "query": {
    "neural": {
      "output_embedding": {
        "query_text": "What is AI search?",
        "model_id": "mBGzipQB2gmRjlv_dOoB",
        "k": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The integration of ML Commons with OpenSearch Ingestion represents a big step forward for large-scale ML data processing and ingestion. OpenSearch Ingestion's multi-pipeline design handles data preparation, batch inference, and ingestion efficiently, supporting AI services like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker. The system can process 1 billion requests with parallel processing and dynamic resource use while cutting batch inference costs by 50% compared to real-time processing. This makes the solution ideal for tasks like semantic search, multimodal search, and document enrichment, where fast and large-scale vector creation is critical. Overall, this integration improves ML-powered search and analytics in OpenSearch, making these operations more accessible, efficient, and cost effective.

## What's next?

Looking ahead, we plan to extend the `ml_inference` processor's capabilities to support real-time model predictions. This enhancement will introduce a new operating mode for the `s3` `scan` source. In this mode, the processor will fully read and process the contents of input files, enabling immediate vector generation through real-time inference. This dual-mode functionality will provide you with the flexibility to choose between efficient batch processing for large-scale operations and real-time processing for immediate inference needs.
