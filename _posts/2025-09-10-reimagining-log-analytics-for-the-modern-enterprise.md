# OpenSearch: Reimagining Log Analytics for the Modern Enterprise

In an era of explosive data growth, organizations are facing a critical challenge: how to manage, analyze, and derive value from their logs without breaking the bank. Traditional proprietary solutions like Splunk have become increasingly expensive, leaving teams searching for a more sustainable approach to observability.


## The Rising Cost of Log Management

As data volumes surge, so do the licensing fees for legacy log analytics platforms. Organizations are caught in a painful cycle of escalating costs that threaten to consume IT budgets without delivering proportional value. Enter OpenSearch—an open-source alternative that's changing the game.


## Piped Processing Language: The Heart of Modern Log Analysis

For Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) and DevOps teams, log analysis is more than just searching and filtering. It's about uncovering deep insights, detecting anomalies, and maintaining system reliability. [OpenSearch's Piped Processing Language (PPL)](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/blob/main/docs/user/ppl/index.rst) is designed to meet these sophisticated needs.


### Beyond Basic Search

Dashboard query language (DQL) in OpenSearch often falls short. OpenSearch's PPL offers:

* Sequential filtering
* Advanced analytics capabilities
* More powerful data exploration with [joins, lookups, and subsearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/enhanced-log-analysis-with-opensearch-ppl-introducing-lookup-join-and-subsearch/)



## A Commitment to Seamless Migration

We understand that switching log analytics platforms is no small feat. That's why OpenSearch is making significant investments to:

* Make PPL syntax more familiar
* Add missing commands and functions
* Simplify the migration process



### Enterprise-Grade Performance with Apache Calcite

Launched in OpenSearch 3.0, [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) represents a breakthrough in log analytics scalability. The platform can now handle enterprise-level data volumes up to 150TB per day, ensuring performance doesn't compromise insight.


## Unifying the Observability Experience

Our current log analytics experience is fragmented. SRE and DevOps teams query their data using Discover and then move to “Visualize” to build a visualization for their dashboard or “Alerting“ to build an alert. In both cases, they are using different languages resulting in a disjoined experience. Now, with the new observability experience for logs that we are building, SRE and DevOps teams can query, build visualizations, and create alerts ([RFC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting/issues/1880)) without leaving their core PPL query experience in Discover. No more learning multiple languages depending on where you are in OpenSearch. Now, there is one language which flows throughout the log analytics experience.


## Getting Started

Implementing the new observability experience is straightforward. Simply update your configuration file with these key attributes in OpenSearch 3.x


```
data_source.enabled: true
workspace.enabled: true
explore.enabled: true
uiSettings:
  overrides:
    "theme:version": v9
    "home:useNewHomePage": true
    "enhancements:enabled": true
opensearch.ignoreVersionMismatch: true
data.savedQueriesNewUI.enabled: true
```



## Why OpenSearch Matters

This isn't just about reducing costs. It's about:

* Empowering teams with flexible, powerful analytics
* Providing enterprise-grade performance
* Maintaining an open, community-driven approach
* Delivering insights without complexity



## The Future of Log Analytics

OpenSearch is more than a tool—it's a vision for how organizations can transform their observability strategy. By prioritizing user needs, performance, and accessibility, we're creating a platform that grows with your challenges.
