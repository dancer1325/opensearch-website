* Category: Machine Learning & AI

## Main Content

* Wherever you work with data * you'll find anomalies
* In increasingly rich information ecosystems * manually detecting and resolving those anomalies can seem like an impossible task
* OpenSearch's built-in capabilities give you the power to create automated * intelligent workflows that identify anomalies * so you can resolve them proactively and minimize disruption

### Three Card Features

#### Point Anomalies
* Image: `/assets/img/pageAssets_usecasepages/pageGraphic-AnomalyDetection-pointGraph.png`
* Class: `card-usecase-img-top`
* **Discover point anomalies** or global outliers like unusually large transfers of funds

#### Contextual Anomalies
* Image: `/assets/img/pageAssets_usecasepages/pageGraphic-AnomalyDetection-Graph.png`
* Class: `card-usecase-img-top`
* **Uncover contextual anomalies** such as unexpected surges in usage or consumption

#### Collective Anomalies
* Image: `/assets/img/pageAssets_usecasepages/pageGraphic-AnomalyDetection-IPAddresses.png`
* Class: `card-usecase-img-top`
* **Observe collective anomalies** * including unusual web traffic from a cluster of IP addresses

### Detection and Resolution at Scale

* Image: `/assets/img/pageAssets_usecasepages/pageGraphic-AnomalyDetection-AnomalyImage.png`
* Eliminate delays to detection and resolution * minimize manual monitoring and troubleshooting * and bridge gaps in visibility to provide insights at scale
* With OpenSearch * you can create and configure detectors that expose anomalies * deliver highly observable results * and send alerts in near real-time
